The technique of segmentation has become an active research process in the field of computer vision. The use has also grown into a popular approach in agricultural, construction, transportation, medical image processing etc. The goal of segmentation is to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding class and to produce a corresponding mask which identifies the exact boundary of the objects in the image. In this research, we aim to explore different deep learning approaches of detecting defects on steel sheet surfaces, then output the same-size segmented images with defected area with the help of U-Net.\\
